    "text": "Lookingto do morewith data and AI?\n    \n  \n\n\n   DATA-CENTRIC AI   |   APPLIED AI   |   COACHING & MENTORING   |   MASTERCLASSES & PUBLIC SPEAKING\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout me\nDr Daniel Kapitan (1973) is a well-rounded data scientist and strategic advisor with years of experience in the field of data, machine learning and digital transformation. His knowledge can help companies to identify how to use AI, and how to integrate this into business processes, roles, and day-to-day operations. He aims to create sustainable change in organizations by systematically engineering data that is required for new AI applications.\nWith a PhD in physics from University of Oxford and currently Fellow at the Eindhoven AI Systems Institute (EAISI), Daniel has a strong scientific grounding in the field. He speaks authoritatively about data-driven transformation programs, reducing complexity to ‘informed simplicity’ for even the most challenging data projects. By combining data and AI know-how with industry expertise, he is capable of bringing about end-to-end business transformation for mid-sized companies, government organizations and scale-ups.\nDaniel starts when organizations are ready to embark on their digital journey, and finishes when people are enabled to continue to work with data and AI by themselves.\n\nRoles\nDaniel works as an advisor, architect, lecturer, applied researcher and mentor. He is one of the few specialists in the Netherlands who has the unique combination of corporate experience, scientific research and executive education. Through these various roles he aims to apply ‘AI for good’. He lectures on data and AI, publishes regularly and is an active member of the Data Sharing Coalition to foster data solidarity and secure data sharing for tackling societal issues.\n\n\nAreas of expertise\nExplainable AI, physics-informed machine learning, data-centric AI, data architecture, federated learning, knowledge science, data commons.\n\n\nIndustry focus\nHealthcare, public sector, OEMs and scale-ups for which data and AI are a core element of their strategy.\n\n\nContact details\nemail: daniel@kapitan.net"

    "text": "Bicycle waste has grown exponentially as cycling has gained more popularity. In the Netherlands, there are more bicycles than people riding them resulting in over one million bikes that become waste on a yearly basis, many of them not ridden once. In this context, no amount of pollution-free cycling can make up for the waste.\nAs such, it’s clear that a new approach is needed, one where waste is reduced as much as possible. Roetz, a bicycle maker from Amsterdam, has spent the last three years working on what they call the “perfect” circular bike, and they believe they have it in the Roetz Life e-bike. The Life bike is an electric bicycle that will last you a lifetime thanks to a modular design and circularity, which means it will be good both for you (and your wallet) and the environment.\nTechnically, no bicycle lasts a lifetime – or for that matter, any other thing. The Life bike is built around a sturdy, two-piece stainless steel frame and integrates several “modules,” which means that you can build the bike of your dreams in the configurator and then change whatever module you want as time goes on.\nThe modular design required a data platform through which the Life bike can be managed and monitored out in the field. Using state-of-the art data architecture patterns, a cloud-based solution was designed that mimics the modularity of the physical systems. Each component (a wheel, the lights etc.) and each activity (initial delivery, riding, locking) was translated into specific data objects and functions, such that the data platform is allowed to evolve over time with subsequent versions of the Life bike. For a scale-up like Roetz, it was particularly important to navigate the trade-offs around consistency, scalability, fault tolerance, and complexity.\nThe Life bike was launched in Spring 2023."
