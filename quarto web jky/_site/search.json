    "text": "There has been a revival of a hypothesis proposed by Rietz (1988) that the possibility of rare disasters, such as economic depressions or wars, is a major determinant of asset risk premia.\n\nIndeed, Barro (2006) has shown that internationally, disasters have been sufficiently frequent and large to make Rietz’s proposal viable and account for the high risk premium on equities. Additionally, the recent economic crisis has given disaster risk a renewed salience.\nThe rare disaster hypothesis is almost always formulated with constant severity of disasters. This is useful for thinking about averages but cannot account for some key features of asset markets, such as volatile price-dividend ratios for stocks, volatile bond risk premia, and return predictability.\nIn this article, I formulate a variable-severity version of the rare disasters hypothesis and investigate the impact of time-varying disaster severity on the prices of stocks and bonds as well as on the predictability of their returns.\nI show that many asset puzzles can be qualitatively understood using this model. I then demonstrate that a parsimonious calibration allows one to understand the puzzles quantitatively, provided that real and nominal variables are sufficiently sensitive to disasters (which I argue is plausible below).\nThe proposed framework allows for a very tractable model of stocks and bonds in which all prices are in closed form. In this setting, the following patterns are not puzzles but emerge naturally when the present model has just two shocks: a real one for stocks and a nominal one for bonds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Market: Puzzles about the Aggregates\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity premium puzzle\nThe standard consumption-based model with reasonable relative risk aversion (less than 10) predicts a too low equity premium (Mehra and Prescott 1985)\n\n\nRisk-free rate puzzle\nIncreasing risk aversion leads to a too high risk-free rate in the standard model (Weil 1989)\n\n\nExcess volatility puzzle\nStock prices seem more volatile than warranted by a model with a constant discount rate (Shiller 1981)\n\n\nAggregate return predictability\nFuture aggregate stock market returns are partly predicted by price/dividend\n\n\n(P/D) and similar ratios (Campbell and Shiller 1998)\n\n\n\n\nTo understand the economics of the model, first consider bonds. Consistent with the empirical evidence reviewed shortly, a disaster leads on average to a positive jump in inflation in the model. This has a greater detrimental impact on long-term bonds, so they command a high risk premium relative to short-term bonds. This explains the upward slope of the nominal yield curve. Next, suppose that the size of the expected jump in inflation itself varies. Then, the slope of the yield curve will vary and predict excess bond returns. A high slope will mean-revert and, thus, predicts a drop in the long rate and high returns on long-term bonds. This mechanism accounts for many stylized facts on bonds.\nThe environment follows Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006), and adds a stochastic probability and severity of disasters.\nThere is a representative agent with utility\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}_0\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty{e}^{-\\rho{t}}\\frac{C_t^{1-\\gamma}-1}{1-\\gamma}\\right],\n\\]\nwhere \\(γ ≥ 0\\) is the coefficient of relative risk aversion and \\(ρ &gt; 0\\) is the rate of time preference.\nShe receives a consumption endowment \\(C_t\\). At each period \\(t + 1\\), a disaster may happen with a probability \\(p_t\\).\nIf a disaster does not happen, \\(\\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t} = e^{g_C}\\), where \\(g_C\\) is the normal-time growth rate of the economy.\nIf a disaster happens, \\(\\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t} = e^{g_C}B_{t+1}\\), where \\(B_{t+1} &gt; 0\\) is a random variable.\nFor instance, if \\(B_{t+1} = 0.8\\), consumption falls by 20%.

    "text": "Bicycle waste has grown exponentially as cycling has gained more popularity. In the Netherlands, there are more bicycles than people riding them resulting in over one million bikes that become waste on a yearly basis, many of them not ridden once. In this context, no amount of pollution-free cycling can make up for the waste.\nAs such, it’s clear that a new approach is needed, one where waste is reduced as much as possible. Roetz, a bicycle maker from Amsterdam, has spent the last three years working on what they call the “perfect” circular bike, and they believe they have it in the Roetz Life e-bike. The Life bike is an electric bicycle that will last you a lifetime thanks to a modular design and circularity, which means it will be good both for you (and your wallet) and the environment.\nTechnically, no bicycle lasts a lifetime – or for that matter, any other thing. The Life bike is built around a sturdy, two-piece stainless steel frame and integrates several “modules,” which means that you can build the bike of your dreams in the configurator and then change whatever module you want as time goes on.\nThe modular design required a data platform through which the Life bike can be managed and monitored out in the field. Using state-of-the art data architecture patterns, a cloud-based solution was designed that mimics the modularity of the physical systems. Each component (a wheel, the lights etc.) and each activity (initial delivery, riding, locking) was translated into specific data objects and functions, such that the data platform is allowed to evolve over time with subsequent versions of the Life bike. For a scale-up like Roetz, it was particularly important to navigate the trade-offs around consistency, scalability, fault tolerance, and complexity.\nThe Life bike was launched in Spring 2023."

His knowledge can help companies to identify how to use AI, and how to integrate this into business processes, roles, and day-to-day operations. He aims to create sustainable change in organizations by systematically engineering data that is required for new AI applications.\nWith a PhD in physics from University of Oxford and currently Fellow at the Eindhoven AI Systems Institute (EAISI), Daniel has a strong scientific grounding in the field. He speaks authoritatively about data-driven transformation programs, reducing complexity to ‘informed simplicity’ for even the most challenging data projects. By combining data and AI know-how with industry expertise, he is capable of bringing about end-to-end business transformation for mid-sized companies, government organizations and scale-ups.\nDaniel starts when organizations are ready to embark on their digital journey, and finishes when people are enabled to continue to work with data and AI by themselves.\n\nRoles\nDaniel works as an advisor, architect, lecturer, applied researcher and mentor. He is one of the few specialists in the Netherlands who has the unique combination of corporate experience, scientific research and executive education. Through these various roles he aims to apply ‘AI for good’. He lectures on data and AI, publishes regularly and is an active member of the Data Sharing Coalition to foster data solidarity and secure data sharing for tackling societal issues.\n\n\nAreas of expertise\nExplainable AI, physics-informed machine learning, data-centric AI, data architecture, federated learning, knowledge science, data commons.\n\n\nIndustry focus\nHealthcare, public sector, OEMs and scale-ups for which data and AI are a core element of their strategy.\n\n\nContact details\nemail: daniel@kapitan.net"
